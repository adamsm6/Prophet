        <div class="w3-container">
         <p>Prophet came to be as a project for Software Design and Documentation, a course taught at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institiute. For this course groups would have to design a project of their choice. The HODLers, the name of our group, decided to do a project around cryptocurrency since it was a hot topic at the start of the the project. Our initial idea involved around making a website where user could log in, have access to their crypto, and trade with the many different exchanges. This idea became a little above our heads when we were disccussing the privacy and issues of holding users many different coins and money. </p>
         <p>This lead us to pivot to the current Prophet that we have today, a predictive algorithm for the crypto world using machine learning. Andy Wu and Adam Lawrence were already very familiar with the crypto world while Mike Adams, Igor Carvalho, and Jeremy Torella had limited experience but were open to learning. </p>

        <h1 class="w3-text-blue w3-padding-16"><i class="w3-margin-right"></i>Why Open Source</h1>
        <div class="w3-container">
        <p> We decided to create this project with the hopes that it would further the progress in the field of machine learning as it relates to cryptocurrency. We believe that the advancement in this field would be most efficient if we allowed the website to be open source. As an open source project, this website becomes a platform for others to test their ideas regarding predictive ML algorithms, and allows a community to form around predicting cryptocurrency price changes.</p>
